# Problem-Sheet
 
## Week 2 Labs <br/>
*Note 07/02/2021 I uploaded this assignment last week, but I didn't realise we needed a separate repository for problem sheets until I went back and read the brief, so it was in my overall PANDs repository until I moved it today

  ## Week 3 Labs <br/>
For this lab I added an extra check, I didn't want the user to proceed if they didn't enter any letters. To do this I added a variable that changed their string to uppercase, and a validation check that would evaluate whether the converted string had any uppercase letters in it. I I added a while loop that would keep asking them to enter a sentence, unless their string contained uppercase letters. If the string did contain uppercase letters, then the original string would be reversed and printed
